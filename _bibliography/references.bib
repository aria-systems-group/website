  abstract={Anticipating a human collaborator's intention enables safe and efficient interaction between a human and an autonomous system. Specifically, in the context of semiautonomous driving, studies have revealed that correct and timely prediction of the driver's intention needs to be an essential part of Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS) design. To this end, we propose a framework that exploits drivers' time-series eye gaze and fixation patterns to anticipate their real-time intention over possible future manoeuvres, enabling a smart and collaborative ADAS that can aid drivers to overcome safety-critical situations. The method models human intention as the latent states of a hidden Markov model and uses probabilistic dynamic time warping distributions to capture the temporal characteristics of the observation patterns of the drivers. The method is evaluated on a data set of 124 experiments from 75 drivers collected in a safety-critical semi-autonomous driving scenario. The results illustrate the efficacy of the framework by correctly anticipating the drivers' intentions about 3 seconds beforehand with over 90\% accuracy.},

  abstract={Stochastic processes are expressive mathematical tools for modeling real-world systems that are subject to uncertainty. It is hence crucial to be able to formally analyze the behavior of these processes, especially in safety-critical applications. Most of the existing formal methods are not designed for continuous-time processes, and those that are typically suffering from state explosion in practice. This article introduces a theoretical framework and a scalable computational method for formal analysis and control synthesis for switched diffusions, a class of stochastic models with linear dynamics that are continuous in both time and space domains; the focus is on safety with possible extensions to other properties. The proposed framework first constructs a finite abstraction in the form of an uncertain Markov process through discretization of both time and space domains. The errors caused by the discretization in each domain are formally characterized and cast into the abstraction model. Then, a strategy that maximizes the probability of the safety property and is robust against the errors is synthesized over the abstraction model. Finally, this robust strategy is mapped to a switching strategy for the stochastic processes that guarantees the safety property. The framework is demonstrated in three case studies, including one that illustrates the tradeoff of the error contribution by the time and space discretization parameters.},

In safety-critical systems, the plan is typically checked by a human supervisor, who decides on whether to allow its execution. In such cases, we wish to convince the human that the plan is indeed collision free.To this end, we propose an explanation scheme for MAPF, which bases explanations on simplicity of visual verification by human's cognitive process. The scheme decomposes a plan into segments such that within each segment, the paths of the agents are disjoint. Then, we can convince the supervisor that the plan is collision free using a small number of images (dubbed an explanation). In addition, we can measure the simplicity of a plan by the number of segments required for the decomposition. We study the complexity of algorithmic problems that arise by the explanation scheme, as well as the tradeoff between the length (makespan) of a plan and its minimal decomposition. We also provide experimental results of our scheme both in a continuous and in a discrete setting.},

We present a novel verification framework for an unknown dynamical system from a given set of noisy observations of the dynamics. Using Gaussian processes trained on this data set, the framework abstracts the system as an uncertain Markov process with discrete states defined over the safe set. The transition bounds of the abstraction are derived from the probabilistic error bounds between the regression and underlying system. An existing approach for verifying safety properties over uncertain Markov processes then generates safety guarantees. We demonstrate the versatility of the framework on several examples, including switched and nonlinear systems.},

  abstract={Many systems are naturally modeled as Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), combining probabilities and strategic actions. Given a model of a system as an MDP and some logical specification of system behavior, the goal of synthesis is to find a policy that maximizes the probability of achieving this behavior. A popular choice for defining behaviors is Linear Temporal Logic (LTL). Policy synthesis on MDPs for properties specified in LTL has been well studied. LTL, however, is defined over infinite traces, while many properties of interest are inherently finite. Linear Temporal Logic over finite traces (LTLf) has been used to express such properties, but no tools exist to solve policy synthesis for MDP behaviors given finite-trace properties. We present two algorithms for solving this synthesis problem: the first via reduction of LTLf to LTL and the second using native tools for LTLf. We compare the scalability of these two approaches for synthesis and show that the native approach offers better scalability compared to existing automaton generation tools for LTL.},

  abstract={We present a data-driven framework for strategy synthesis for partially-known switched stochastic systems. The properties of the system are specified using linear temporal logic (LTL) over finite traces (LTLf), which is as expressive as LTL and enables interpretations over finite behaviors. The framework first learns the unknown dynamics via Gaussian process regression. Then, it builds a formal abstraction of the switched system in terms of an uncertain Markov model, namely an Interval Markov Decision Process (IMDP), by accounting for both the stochastic behavior of the system and the uncertainty in the learning step. Then, we synthesize a strategy on the resulting IMDP that maximizes the satisfaction probability of the LTLf specification and is robust against all the uncertainties in the abstraction. This strategy is then refined into a switching strategy for the original stochastic system. We show that this strategy is near-optimal and provide a bound on its distance (error) to the optimal strategy. We experimentally validate our framework on various case studies, including both linear and non-linear switched stochastic systems.},

We show that standard notions of optimality (e.g., makespan) may create conflict with short explanations.

We demonstrate the efficacy of this explanation-planning scheme and extensively evaluate the performance of MAPS-X and its lazy variant in various environments and agent dynamics.},

This collaboration introduces challenges: the robot must plan while taking the human’s actions into account. In prior work, the problem was posed as a 2-player deterministic game, with a limited number of human moves. The limit on human moves is unintuitive, and in many settings determinism is undesirable. In this paper, we present a novel planning method for collaborative human-robot manipulation tasks via probabilistic synthesis. We introduce a probabilistic manipulation domain that captures the interaction by allowing for both robot and human actions with states that represent the configurations of the objects in the workspace. The task is specified using Linear Temporal Logic over finite traces (LTLf). We then transform our manipulation domain into a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and synthesize an optimal policy to satisfy the specification on this MDP. We present two novel contributions: a formalization of probabilistic manipulation domains allowing us to apply existing techniques and a comparison of different encodings of these domains. Our framework is validated on a physical UR5 robot.},

  abstract={This paper proposes a framework for learning task specifications from demonstrations, while ensuring that the learned specifications do not violate safety constraints. Furthermore, we show how these specifications can be used in a planning problem to control the robot under environments that can be different from those encountered during the learning phase. We formulate the specification learning problem as a grammatical inference problem, using probabilistic automata to represent specifications. The edge probabilities of the resulting automata represent the demonstrator's preferences. The main novelty in our approach is to incorporate the safety property during the learning process. We prove that the resulting automaton always respects a pre-specified safety property, and furthermore, the proposed method can easily be included in any Evidence-Driven State Merging (EDSM)-based automaton learning scheme. Finally, we introduce a planning algorithm that produces the most desirable plan by maximizing the probability of an accepting trace of the automaton. Case studies show that our algorithm learns the true probability distribution most accurately while maintaining safety. Since, specification is detached from the robot's environment model, a satisfying plan can be synthesized for a variety of different robots and environments including both mobile robots and manipulators.},

  abstract={Safe autonomous navigation is an essential and challenging problem for robots operating in highly unstructured or completely unknown environments. Under these conditions, not only robotic systems must deal with limited localization information but also their maneuverability is constrained by their dynamics and often suffers from uncertainty. In order to cope with these constraints, this article proposes an uncertainty-based framework for mapping and planning feasible motions online with probabilistic safety guarantees. The proposed approach deals with the motion, probabilistic safety, and online computation constraints by: 1) incrementally mapping the surroundings to build an uncertainty-aware representation of the environment and 2) iteratively (re)planning trajectories to goal that is kinodynamically feasible and probabilistically safe through a multilayered sampling-based planner in the belief space. In-depth empirical analyses illustrate some important properties of this approach, namely: 1) the multilayered planning strategy enables rapid exploration of the high-dimensional belief space while preserving asymptotic optimality and completeness guarantees and 2) the proposed routine for probabilistic collision checking results in tighter probability bounds in comparison to other uncertainty-aware planners in the literature. Furthermore, real-world in-water experimental evaluation on a nonholonomic torpedo-shaped autonomous underwater vehicle and simulated trials in an urban environment on an unmanned aerial vehicle demonstrate the efficacy of the method and its suitability for systems with limited onboard computational power. Note to Practitioners—Emergent robotic applications require operating in previously unmapped scenarios. This article presents a unified mapping–planning strategy that enables robots to navigate autonomously and safely in harsh environments.},

  abstract={Autonomous systems often have complex and possibly unknown dynamics due to, e.g., black-box components. This leads to unpredictable behaviors and makes control design with performance guarantees a major challenge. This paper presents a data-driven control synthesis framework for such systems subject to linear temporal logic on finite traces (LTLf) specifications. The framework combines a baseline (offline) controller with a novel online controller and refinement procedure that improves the baseline guarantees as new data is collected. The baseline controller is computed offline on an uncertain abstraction constructed using Gaussian process (GP) regression on a given dataset. The offline controller provides a lower bound on the probability of satisfying the LTLf specification, which may be far from optimal due to both discretization and regression errors. The synergy arises from the online controller using the offline abstraction along with the current state and new data to choose the next best action. The online controller may improve the baseline guarantees since it avoids the discretization error and reduces regression error as new data is collected. The new data are also used to refine the abstraction and offline controller using local GP regression, which significantly reduces the computation overhead. Evaluations show the efficacy of the proposed offline-online framework, especially when compared against the offline controller.},

The controller chooses between discrete flight modes to image a target with different sensor types. The safety constraints include maintaining safe battery levels, reaction wheel speeds, and body rates. The proposed approach applies shielded deep reinforcement learning (SDRL) to autonomously command spacecraft flight modes, where the imaging requirements are communicated to the agent through a finite-state machine (FSM). The training is done in a target- and orbit-agnostic manner to create a single artificial neural network that can operate in a range of conditions. The FSM specifies which sensor type the agent should use for the next image. Simulation results based on a spacecraft tasked on Boulder, CO, USA demonstrate that this approach is effective for commanding a spacecraft safely while meeting predefined imaging requirements. This work also demonstrates how an agent trained on Boulder is capable of being applied to other Earth-targets as well as targets on the Moon with similar performance.},

Thus our robotic explorers must be capable of autonomous operations to ensure continued operations and to try to maximize the amount and quality of the scientific data gathered from each mission. To advance our technology toward this goal, we are developing a system to maximize the science obtained by a robotic lander and delivered to scientists on Earth with minimal asynchronous human interaction. The autonomy architecture consists of three main components: Shared Science Value Maps (SSVMs), which function as an interface between REASON (Robust Exploration with Autonomous Science onboard) and RECOURSE (Ranked Evaluation of Contingent Opportunities for Uninterrupted Remote Science Exploration) for efficient and useful scientific communication between scientists and robot. The key advantage to this design is in its ability to continuously operate and adapt despite the constraints of high-latency, low-bandwith communications and an uncertain environment which today would require ground-in-the-loop operations. This paper presents the overview of our architecture and initial results on the development of such a system. These results will focus on progress made in developing the details of the SSVM interface between human scientists and robotic explorer and the ability of REASON to act on the SSVM to develop plans on-board that attempt to maximize science obtained while being guaranteed to respect any relevant system and safety constraints.},

In safety-critical applications, a human supervisor may want to verify that the plan is indeed collision-free. To this end, a recent work introduces a notion of explainability for MAPF based on a visualization of the plan as a short sequence of images representing time segments, where in each time segment the trajectories of the agents are disjoint. Then, the problem of Explainable MAPF via Segmentation asks for a set of non-colliding paths that admit a short-enough explanation. Explainable MAPF adds a new difficulty to MAPF, in that it is NP-hard with respect to the size of the environment, and not just the number of agents. Thus, traditional MAPF algorithms are not equipped to directly handle Explainable MAPF. In this work, we adapt Conflict Based Search (CBS), a well-studied algorithm for MAPF, to handle Explainable MAPF. We show how to add explainability constraints on top of the standard CBS tree and its underlying A* search. We examine the usefulness of this approach and, in particular, the trade-off between planning time and explainability.},

The focus is on specifications expressed in linear temporal logic interpreted over finite traces (LTLf), and the approach is based on finite abstraction. Specifically, we leverage recent techniques for convex relaxation of NNs to formally abstract a NNDM into an interval Markov decision process (IMDP). Then, a strategy that maximizes the probability of satisfying a given specification is synthesized over the IMDP and mapped back to the underlying NNDM. We show that the process of abstracting NNDMs to IMDPs reduces to a set of convex optimization problems, hence guaranteeing efficiency. We also present an adaptive refinement procedure that makes the framework scalable. On several case studies, we illustrate that our framework is able to provide non-trivial guarantees of correctness for NNDMs with architectures of up to 5 hidden layers and hundreds of neurons per layer.},

Due to its complexity, existing algorithms are either incomplete, or utilize simplifying assumptions. This work introduces Kinodynamic Conflict-Based Search (K-CBS), a decentralized MRMP algorithm that is general, scalable, and probabilistically complete. The algorithm takes inspiration from successful solutions to the discrete analogue of MRMP over finite graphs, known as Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF). Specifically, we adapt ideas from Conflict-Based Search (CBS)-a popular decentralized MAPF algorithm-to the MRMP setting. The novelty of our approach is that we work directly in the continuous domain, without discretization. In particular, the kinodynamic constraints are treated natively. K-CBS plans for each robot individually using a low-level planner and grows a conflict tree to resolve collisions between robots by defining constraints. The low-level planner can be any sampling-based, tree-search algorithm for kinodynamic robots, thus lifting existing planners for single robots to the multi-robot setting. We show that K-CBS inherits the (probabilistic) completeness of the low-level planner. We illustrate the generality and performance of K-CBS in several case studies and benchmarks.},

Our approach is based on a novel belief space discretization technique that abstracts a continuous-space dynamics model for ET estimation to a finite Markov decision process. We show this abstraction method is more efficient than alternatives and also benefits from interpretability. Then, we leverage off-the-shelf tools to compute the set of all optimal trade-offs between resource consumption and task performance. Given a choice from this set, we synthesize an ET-threshold strategy that achieves the desirable behavior.

  abstract={We present an algorithm for learning switched linear dynamical systems in discrete time from noisy observations of the system's full state or output. Switched linear systems use multiple linear dynamical modes to fit the data within some desired tolerance. They arise quite naturally in applications to robotics and cyber-physical systems. Learning switched systems from data is a NP-hard problem that is nearly identical to the k-linear regression problem of fitting k > 1 linear models to the data. A direct mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) approach yields time complexity that is exponential in the number of data points. In this paper, we modify the problem formulation to yield an algorithm that is linear in the size of the data while remaining exponential in the number of state variables and the desired number of modes. To do so, we combine classic ideas from the ellipsoidal method for solving convex optimization problems, and well-known oracle separation results in non-smooth optimization. We demonstrate our approach on a set of microbenchmarks and a few interesting real-world problems. Our evaluation suggests that the benefits of this algorithm can be made practical even against highly optimized off-the-shelf MILP solvers.},

We derive a novel method for offline propagation of the expected state distribution, and corresponding bounds on this distribution.

  abstract={Interval Markov Decision Processes (IMDPs) are finite-state uncertain Markov models, where the transition probabilities belong to intervals. Recently, there has been a surge of research on employing IMDPs as abstractions of stochastic systems for control synthesis. However, due to the absence of algorithms for synthesis over IMDPs with continuous action-spaces, the action-space is assumed discrete a-priori, which is a restrictive assumption for many applications. Motivated by this, we introduce continuous-action IMDPs (caIMDPs), where the bounds on transition probabilities are functions of the action variables, and study value iteration for maximizing expected cumulative rewards. Specifically, we decompose the max-min problem associated to value iteration to |𝒬| max problems, where |𝒬| is the number of states of the caIMDP. Then, exploiting the simple form of these max problems, we identify cases where value iteration over caIMDPs can be solved efficiently (e.g., with linear or convex programming). We also gain other interesting insights: e.g., in certain cases where the action set 𝒜 is a polytope, synthesis over a discrete-action IMDP, where the actions are the vertices of 𝒜, is sufficient for optimality. We demonstrate our results on a numerical example. Finally, we include a short discussion on employing caIMDPs as abstractions for control synthesis.},

  abstract={Future planetary exploration missions on the surface of distant bodies such as Europa or Enceladus can't rely on human-in-the-loop operations due to time delays, dynamic environments, limited mission lifetimes, as well as the many unknown unknowns inherent in the exploration of such environments. Thus our robotic explorers must be capable of autonomous operations to ensure continued operations and to try to maximize the amount and quality of the scientific data gathered from each mission. To advance our technology toward this goal, we are developing a system to maximize the science obtained by a robotic lander and delivered to scientists on Earth with minimal asynchronous human interaction. The autonomy architecture consists of two main components: REASON (Robust Exploration with Autonomous Science on-board) and RECOURSE (Ranked Evaluation of Contingent Opportunities for Uninterrupted Remote Science Exploration) for efficient and useful scientific communication between scientists and robot. The key advantage to this design is in its ability to continuously operate and adapt despite the constraints of high-latency, low-bandwith communications and an uncertain environment which today would require ground-in-the-loop operations. This paper presents the initial version of the REASON-RECOURSE system. Details of the implementation of the scientist interface and interaction with the ground software - RECOURSE - and the on-board robotic planning software - REASON - are given. Demonstration of the operation using NASA's OceanWATERS testbed will be shown.},

TPOs naturally allow us to capture event ordering, along with a restricted but useful class of timing relationships. Next, we consider the problem of mining TPO schedules from workflow logs, which include events along with their time stamps. We demonstrate a relationship between formulating TPOs and the graph-coloring problem, and present an algorithm for learning TPOs with correctness guarantees. We demonstrate our approach on synthetic datasets, including two datasets inspired by real-life applications of aircraft turnaround and gameplay videos of the Overcooked computer game. Our TPO mining algorithm can infer TPOs involving hundreds of events from thousands of data-points within a few seconds. We show that the resulting TPOs provide useful insights into the dependencies and timing constraints for workflows.},

Given a compact set of input points $T\subset \mathbb{R}^n$, BNN-DP computes lower and upper bounds on the BNN’s predictions for all the points in $T$. The framework is based on an interpretation of BNNs as stochastic dynamical systems, which enables the use of Dynamic Programming (DP) algorithms to bound the prediction range along the layers of the network. Specifically, the method uses bound propagation techniques and convex relaxations to derive a backward recursion procedure to over-approximate the prediction range of the BNN with piecewise affine functions. The algorithm is general and can handle both regression and classification tasks. On a set of experiments on various regression and classification tasks and BNN architectures, we show that BNN-DP outperforms state-of-the-art methods by up to four orders of magnitude in both tightness of the bounds and computational efficiency.},

For synthesis, we first introduce value iteration algorithms for such games with min-max objectives. Then, we extend our method to the regret-minimizing objectives. Our benchmarks reveal that our the symbolic framework not only significantly improves computation time (up to an order of magnitude) but also can scale up to much larger instances of manipulation problems with up to 2× number of objects and locations than the state of the art.},

  abstract = {Autonomous robots are increasingly utilized in realistic scenarios with multiple complex tasks. In these scenarios, there may be a preferred way of completing the tasks, but it is often in conflict with optimal execution. Recent work studies preference-based planning, however, they have yet to extend the notion of preference to the behavior of the robot with respect to each task. In this work, we introduce a novel notion of preference that provides a generalized framework to express preferences over individual tasks as well as their relations. We perform an optimal trade-off (Pareto) analysis between behaviors that adhere to the user's preference and the ones that are resource optimal. We introduce an efficient planning framework that generates Pareto-optimal plans given user's preference by extending A* search. Further, we show a method of computing the entire Pareto front (the set of all optimal trade-offs) via an adaptation of a multi-objective A* algorithm. We also present a search heuristic to enable scalability. We illustrate the power of the framework on both mobile robots and manipulators. Our benchmarks show the effectiveness of the heuristic with up to 2-orders of magnitude speedup.},

  abstract={Verifying the performance of safety-critical, stochastic systems with complex noise distributions is difficult. We introduce a general procedure for the finite abstraction of nonlinear stochastic systems with non-standard (e.g., non-affine, non-symmetric, non-unimodal) noise distributions for verification purposes. The method uses a finite partitioning of the noise domain to construct an interval Markov chain (IMC) abstraction of the system via transition probability intervals. Noise partitioning allows for a general class of distributions and structures, including multiplicative and mixture models, and admits both known and data-driven systems. The partitions required for optimal transition bounds are specified for systems that are monotonic with respect to the noise, and explicit partitions are provided for affine and multiplicative structures. By the soundness of the abstraction procedure, verification on the IMC provides guarantees on the stochastic system against a temporal logic specification. In addition, we present a novel refinement-free algorithm that improves the verification results. Case studies on linear and nonlinear systems with non-Gaussian noise, including a data-driven example, demonstrate the generality and effectiveness of the method without introducing excessive conservatism.},

We model the evolution of the hybrid system as a two-player game, where the nondeterminism is an adversarial player whose objective is to prevent achieving temporal and reachability goals. The aim is to synthesize a winning strategy – a reactive (robust) strategy that guarantees the satisfaction of the goals under all possible moves of the adversarial player. Our proposed approach involves growing a (search) game-tree in the hybrid space by combining sampling-based motion planning with a novel bandit-based technique to select and improve on partial strategies. We show that the algorithm is probabilistically complete, i.e., the algorithm will asymptotically almost surely find a winning strategy, if one exists. The case studies and benchmark results show that our algorithm is general and effective, and consistently outperforms state of the art algorithms.},

  abstract={As robots become more prevalent, the complexity of robot-robot, robot-human, and robot-environment interactions increases. In these interactions, a robot needs to consider not only the effects of its own actions, but also the effects of other agents’ actions and the possible interactions between agents. Previous works have considered reactive synthesis, where the human/environment is modeled as a deterministic, adversarial agent; as well as probabilistic synthesis, where the human/environment is modeled via a Markov chain. While they provide strong theoretical frameworks, there are still many aspects of human-robot interaction that cannot be fully expressed and many assumptions that must be made in each model. In this work, we propose stochastic games as a general model for human-robot interaction, which subsumes the expressivity of all previous representations. In addition, it allows us to make fewer modeling assumptions and leads to more natural and powerful models of interaction. We introduce the semantics of this abstraction and show how existing tools can be utilized to synthesize strategies to achieve complex tasks with guarantees. Further, we discuss the current computational limitations and improve the scalability by two orders of magnitude by a new way of constructing models for PRISM-games.},

  abstract={Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) is the problem of planning paths for agents to reach their targets from their start locations, such that the agents do not collide while executing the plan. In many settings, the plan (or a digest thereof) is conveyed to a supervising entity, e.g., for confirmation before execution, for a report, etc. In such cases, we wish to convey that the plan is collision-free with minimal amount of information. To this end, we propose an explanation scheme for MAPF. The scheme decomposes a plan into segments such that within each segment, the agents' paths are disjoint. We can then convey the plan whilst convincing that it is collision-free, using a small number of frames (dubbed an explanation). We can also measure the simplicity of a plan by the number of segments required for the decomposition. We study the complexity of algorithmic problems that arise by the explanation scheme and the tradeoff between the length (makespan) of a plan and its minimal decomposition. We also introduce two centralized (i.e. runs on a single CPU with full knowledge of the multi-agent system) algorithms for planning with explanations. One is based on a coupled search algorithm similar to A⁎, and the other is a decoupled method based on Conflict-Based Search (CBS). We refer to the latter as Explanation-Guided CBS (XG-CBS), which uses a low-level search for individual agents and maintains a high-level conflict tree to guide the low-level search to avoid collisions as well as increasing the number of segments. We propose four approaches to the low-level search of XG-CBS by modifying A⁎ for explanations and analyze their effects on the completeness of XG-CBS. Finally, we highlight important aspects of the proposed explanation scheme in various MAPF problems and empirically evaluate the performance of the proposed planning algorithms in a series of benchmark problems.},

  abstract={We consider a Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) setting where agents have been assigned a plan, but during its execution some agents are delayed. Instead of replanning from scratch when such a delay occurs, we propose delay introduction, whereby we delay some additional agents so that the remainder of the plan can be executed safely. We show that finding the minimum number of additional delays is APX-hard. However, in practice we can find optimal delay-introductions using Conflict-Based Search for very large numbers of agents, and both planning time and the resulting length of the plan are comparable, and sometimes outperform the state-of-the-art heuristics for replanning.},

  abstract={In this paper, we present IntervalMDP.jl, a Julia package for probabilistic analysis of interval Markov Decision Processes (IMDPs). IntervalMDP.jl facilitates the synthesis of optimal strategies and verification of IMDPs against reachability specifications and discounted reward properties. The library supports sparse matrices and is compatible with data formats from common tools for the analysis of probabilistic models, such as PRISM. A key feature of IntervalMDP.jl is that it presents both a multi-threaded CPU and a GPU-accelerated implementation of value iteration algorithms for IMDPs. In particular, IntervalMDP.jl takes advantage of the Julia type system and the inherently parallelizable nature of value iteration to improve the efficiency of performing analysis of IMDPs. On a set of examples, we show that IntervalMDP.jl substantially outperforms existing tools for verification and strategy synthesis for IMDPs in both computation time and memory consumption.},

  abstract = {Many sequential decision problems involve optimizing one objective function while imposing constraints on other objectives. Constrained Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (C-POMDP) model this case with transition uncertainty and partial observability. In this work, we first show that C-POMDPs violate the optimal substructure property over successive decision steps and thus may exhibit behaviors that are undesirable for some (e.g., safety critical) applications. Additionally, online re-planning in C-POMDPs is often ineffective due to the inconsistency resulting from this violation. To address these drawbacks, we introduce the Recursively-Constrained POMDP (RC-POMDP), which imposes additional history-dependent cost constraints on the C-POMDP. We show that, unlike C-POMDPs, RC-POMDPs always have deterministic optimal policies and that optimal policies obey Bellman's principle of optimality. We also present a point-based dynamic programming algorithm for RC-POMDPs. Evaluations on benchmark problems demonstrate the efficacy of our algorithm and show that policies for RC-POMDPs produce more desirable behaviors than policies for C-POMDPs.},

  abstract = {Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) are powerful models for sequential decision making under transition and observation uncertainties. This paper studies the challenging yet important problem in POMDPs known as the (indefinite-horizon) Maximal Reachability Probability Problem (MRPP), where the goal is to maximize the probability of reaching some target states. This is also a core problem in model checking with logical specifications and is naturally undiscounted (discount factor is one). Inspired by the success of point-based methods developed for discounted problems, we study their extensions to MRPP. Specifically, we focus on trial-based heuristic search value iteration techniques and present a novel algorithm that leverages the strengths of these techniques for efficient exploration of the belief space (informed search via value bounds) while addressing their drawbacks in handling loops for indefinite-horizon problems. The algorithm produces policies with two-sided bounds on optimal reachability probabilities. We prove convergence to an optimal policy from below under certain conditions. Experimental evaluations on a suite of benchmarks show that our algorithm outperforms existing methods in almost all cases in both probability guarantees and computation time.},

  abstract={In this paper, we introduce a data-driven framework for synthesis of provably-correct controllers for general nonlinear switched systems under complex specifications. The focus is on systems with unknown disturbances whose effects on the dynamics of the system is nonlinear. The specification is assumed to be given as linear temporal logic over finite traces (LTLf) formulas. Starting from observations of either the disturbance or the state of the system, we first learn an ambiguity set that contains the unknown distribution of the disturbances with a user-defined confidence. Next, we obtain a robust Markov decision process (RMDP) as a finite abstraction of the system. By composing the RMDP with the automaton obtained from the LTLf formula and performing optimal robust value iteration on the composed RMDP, we synthesize a strategy that yields a high probability that the uncertain system satisfies the specifications. Our empirical evaluations on systems with a wide variety of disturbances show that the strategies synthesized with our approach lead to high satisfaction probabilities and validate the theoretical guarantees.},

The first step is learning the dynamics of the system via Gaussian Process (GP) regression and obtaining probabilistic errors for this estimate. Then, we develop an algorithm for constructing piecewise stochastic barrier functions to find a maximal permissible strategy set using the learned GP model, which is based on sequentially pruning the worst controls until a maximal set is identified. The permissible strategies are guaranteed to maintain probabilistic safety for the true system. This is especially important for learned systems, because a rich strategy space enables additional data collection and complex behaviors while remaining safe. Case studies on linear and nonlinear systems demonstrate that increasing the size of the dataset for learning grows the permissible strategy set.},

In this work, we focus on discrete-time non-linear stochastic dynamical systems. We present a novel approach to approximate the distribution of the system over a given finite time horizon with a mixture of distributions. The key novelty of our approach is that it not only provides tractable approximations for the distribution of a nonlinear stochastic system but also comes with formal guarantees of correctness. In particular, we consider the Total Variation (TV) distance to quantify the distance between two distributions and derive an upper bound on the TV between the distribution of the original system and the approximating mixture distribution derived from our framework. We show that in various cases of interest, including in the case of Gaussian noise, the resulting bound can be efficiently computed in closed form. This allows us to quantify the correctness of the approximation and to optimize the parameters of the resulting mixture distribution to minimize such distance. The effectiveness of our approach is illustrated on several benchmarks from the control community.},

We propose algorithms for the efficient synthesis of distributionally robust control strategies that maximize the satisfaction probability of reach-avoid specifications with either a given or an arbitrary (not specified) time horizon, i.e., unbounded-time reachability. The framework consists of two main steps: finite abstraction and control synthesis. First, we construct a finite abstraction of the switched stochastic system as a robust Markov decision process (robust MDP) that encompasses both the stochasticity of the system and the uncertainty in the noise distribution. Then, we synthesize a strategy that is robust to the distributional uncertainty on the resulting robust MDP. We employ techniques from optimal transport and stochastic programming to reduce the strategy synthesis problem to a set of linear programs, and propose a tailored and efficient algorithm to solve them. The resulting strategies are correctly refined into switching strategies for the original stochastic system. We illustrate the efficacy of our framework on various case studies comprising both linear and non-linear switched stochastic systems.},

  abstract = {Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) is a powerful and elegant method for learning complex functions from noisy data with a wide range of applications, including in safety-critical domains. Such applications have two key features: (i) they require rigorous error quantification, and (ii) the noise is often bounded and non-Gaussian due to, e.g., physical constraints. While error bounds for applying GPR in the presence of non-Gaussian noise exist, they tend to be overly restrictive and conservative in practice. In this paper, we provide novel error bounds for GPR under bounded support noise. Specifically, by relying on concentration inequalities and assuming that the latent function has low complexity in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) corresponding to the GP kernel, we derive both probabilistic and deterministic bounds on the error of the GPR. We show that these errors are substantially tighter than existing state-of-the-art bounds and are particularly well-suited for GPR with neural network kernels, i.e., Deep Kernel Learning (DKL). Furthermore, motivated by applications in safety-critical domains, we illustrate how these bounds can be combined with stochastic barrier functions to successfully quantify the safety probability of an unknown dynamical system from finite data. We validate the efficacy of our approach through several benchmarks and comparisons against existing bounds. The results show that our bounds are consistently smaller, and that DKLs can produce error bounds tighter than sample noise, significantly improving the safety probability of control systems.},

We present Kinodynamic Parallel Accelerated eXpansion (Kino-PAX), a novel highly parallel kinodynamic SBMP designed for parallel devices such as GPUs. Kino-PAX grows a tree of trajectory segments directly in parallel. Our key insight is how to decompose the iterative tree growth process into three massively parallel subroutines. Kino-PAX is designed to align with the parallel device execution hierarchies, through ensuring that threads are largely independent, share equal workloads, and take advantage of low-latency resources while minimizing high-latency data transfers and process synchronization. This design results in a very efficient GPU implementation. We prove that Kino-PAX is probabilistically complete and analyze its scalability with compute hardware improvements. Empirical evaluations demonstrate solutions in the order of $10$ ms on a desktop GPU and in the order of $100$ ms on an embedded GPU, representing  up to $1000\times$ improvement compared to coarse-grained CPU parallelization of state-of-the-art sequential algorithms over a range of complex environments and  systems.},

In this work, we develop a framework for verifying discrete-time dynamical systems with unmodelled dynamics and noisy measurements against temporal logic specifications from an input-output dataset. The verification framework employs Gaussian process (GP) regression to learn the unknown dynamics from the dataset and abstracts the continuous-space system as a finite-state, uncertain Markov decision process (MDP). This abstraction relies on space discretization and transition probability intervals that capture the uncertainty due to the error in GP regression by using reproducible kernel Hilbert space analysis as well as the uncertainty induced by discretization. The framework utilizes existing model checking tools for verification of the uncertain MDP abstraction against a given temporal logic specification. We establish the correctness of extending the verification results on the abstraction created from noisy measurements to the underlying system. We show that the computational complexity of the framework is polynomial in the size of the dataset and discrete abstraction. The complexity analysis illustrates a trade-off between the quality of the verification results and the computational burden to handle larger datasets and finer abstractions. Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of our learning and verification framework on several case studies with linear, nonlinear, and switched dynamical systems.},

  Abstract={Shielding is a common method used to guarantee the safety of a system under a black-box controller, such as a neural network controller from deep reinforcement learning (DRL), with simpler, verified controllers. Existing shielding methods rely on formal verification through Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), assuming either known or finite-state models, which limits their applicability to DRL settings with unknown, continuous-state systems. This paper addresses these limitations by proposing a data-driven shielding methodology that guarantees safety for unknown systems under black-box controllers. The approach leverages Deep Kernel Learning to model the systems' one-step evolution with uncertainty quantification and constructs a finite-state abstraction as an Interval MDP (IMDP). By focusing on safety properties expressed in safe linear temporal logic (safe LTL), we develop an algorithm that computes the maximally permissive set of safe policies on the IMDP, ensuring avoidance of unsafe states. The algorithms soundness and computational complexity are demonstrated through theoretical proofs and experiments on nonlinear systems, including a high-dimensional autonomous spacecraft scenario.},

The uncertainty in the resulting UMDP is used to formally account for both the error in abstracting the system and for the uncertainty coming from the data. Critically, we show that for any given state-action pair in the resulting UMDP, the uncertainty in the transition probabilities can be represented as a convex polytope obtained by a two-layer state discretization and concentration inequalities. This allows us to obtain tighter uncertainty estimates compared to existing approaches, and guarantees efficiency, as we tailor a synthesis algorithm exploiting the structure of this UMDP. We empirically validate our approach on several case studies, showing substantially improved performance compared to the state-of-the-art.},
