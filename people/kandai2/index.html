<p class="mbr-text text1 mbr-light mbr-fonts-style display-7">I’m a postdoc in the <a href="https://ariasystems.group/index.html">ARIA Systems Group</a> and <a href="https://plv.colorado.edu/">CUPLV</a>. I received my Ph.D. in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Colorado Boulder. I got my Bachelor’s and Master’s Degree at Keio University, Japan and also studied at University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign during my Bachelor’s Degree. My research interest lies in the intersection between Control Theory, Optimization Theory and Probability Theory. I’m especially interested in long-term task learning for a robot to accomplish complex tasks like cooking. I have experiences in low-level engineering (circuit design, sensor fetching, sensor fusion, filtering, and controller design) as well as high-level decision making algorithms (e.g. Reinforcement Learning). At ARIA Systems Group, I envision to synthesize high-level task learning (e.g. formal methods) with the low-level primitive policy learning (e.g. RL).</p>
