<p>Hey! I’m Riana and I’m a Senior In Aerospace Engineering with minors in Business and Astronomy at the University of Colorado Boulder. I enjoy research and teaching and would like to continue my studies to earn my postgraduate degree. My interests lie in dynamics, controls and autonomous systems. In my free time I enjoy traveling and being outdoors.</p>
