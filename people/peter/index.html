<p>Hey, my name is Peter. I am a first year master’s student studying Aerospace Engineering with a focus on autonomous systems at the University of Colorado Boulder. I spent my undergraduate years here at CU Boulder as well, receiving a degree in Aerospace Engineering with a double minor in Mathematics and Physics. Throughout my undergraduate career, I became more and more intrigued by problems in computer science. I found a hidden passion for solving complex engineering and computer science problems by designing efficient and modular algorithms. Halfway through my junior year, I joined the ARIA systems research group. Within the first month or two, I realized that I had found a field of study that combined all of my technical and career interests. After working on a few simple projects and implementations, I decided that I wanted to shift the direction of my graduate studies to autonomous systems.</p>

<p>Throughout my time with ARIA I have been involved in multiple projects and collaborations such as generating discrete model abstractions, designing a low level action-execution architecture for robotic manipulators in ROS, creating an efficient formal synthesis toolbox in C++, as well as my personal research.</p>

<p>I am part of a five-person group project named COLDTech (funded by NASA) that is aimed towards extending safe, autonomous capability to a remote space lander with low-bandwidth, high-latency communication to Earth. My contributions to this project include theoretical development of the on-board task-planner. My current research is focused on synthesizing a high-level plan that efficiently satisfies a set of task preferences while respecting a user-defined priority for each task. This would allow a group of scientists on Earth to uplink only a prioritized set of tasks to the lander, after which the lander is autonomously responsible for synthesizing a high-level plan. The plan must allow the lander to efficiently satisfy all of the tasks while aiming to complete higher priority tasks before lower priority tasks.</p>

<p>This research would extend the capabilities of robots and other autonomous systems under scenarios where multiple tasks are given.</p>

<p><strong>Research Keywords:</strong> Formal synthesis, planning with preferences, hybrid systems, formal methods</p>
