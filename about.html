  <h1>About ARIA Systems Group</h1>

  <div class="entry">
    <p>We are a group of robot enthusiasts in the Departments of Aerospace Engineering Sciences and Computer Science at the University of Colorado Boulder set on developing <strong>A</strong>ssured, <strong>R</strong>eliable, and <strong>I</strong>nteractive <strong>A</strong>utonomous (ARIA) systems.  We envision a world where autonomous systems operate safely and effectively alongside humans and form trusting partnerships to improve the well-being of individuals and societies.  This vision drives our research in developing theoretical foundations and computational frameworks that enable reliable and intelligent autonomy.  We view this as an art, a creative process that requires deep technical understandings of the fields that contribute to robotics.</p>

<p>The main theme of our work is safety and soundness, and the emphasis is on safe autonomy through correct-by-construction algorithmic approaches.  Our research builds on knowledge developed in control theory, formal methods, statistical reasoning, machine learning &amp; AI and seeks to address real-world challenges in robotics and safety-critical systems.
