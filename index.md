ARIA Systems group develops novel theoretical foundations and computational frameworks to enable reliable and intelligent autonomy. The main theme of our work is safety and soundness, and the emphasis is on safe autonomy through correct-by-construction algorithmic approaches. Our research within the Department of Aerospace Engineering Sciences at the University of Colorado Boulder builds on knowledge developed in control theory, formal methods, statistical reasoning, machine learning &amp; AI to address real-world challenges in robotics and safety-critical systems.
