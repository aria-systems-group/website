<!-- ## This workshop is cancelled

**We are sad to say that the workshop will not take place as part of RSS this year.  Many of the invited speakers are unfortunately unable to attend the workshop in person.  Since that affects the quality of the workshop, we decided to postpone it to another conference to ensure that the workshop will be productive with a good turnout.  We will soon make an announcement which conference we will target next.** -->

As autonomous robotic systems transition from controlled labs to unstructured, high-stakes environments, the traditional decoupling between perception, planning, and control is becoming untenable. Imperfections in these subsystems are inescapable byproducts of operating in the physical world. Failure to account for them leads to overconfident behaviors, where a robot assumes an accurate world state despite partial or imperfect measurements and observations. In safety-critical settings, this can result in catastrophic failures, such as collisions with unseen obstacles or loss of localization or tracking in feature-poor areas.

Yet, properly accounting for sensors and their imperfections is notoriously difficult. Tightly coupling perception, planning and control requires reasoning over very high-dimensional problem spaces, which is often computationally prohibitive for real-time applications. Additionally, accurate modeling of sensor and perception uncertainty is complicated due to the increasingly black-box nature of modern perception stacks.

This workshop addresses the critical need for techniques that account for imperfect perception during planning. Our focus is on strategies where robots do not just react to sensory data, but actively plan by reasoning over sensory information and limitations (e.g., neural network labeling faults or field-of-view constraints). Particular emphasis is on robust techniques with safety considerations. The objective is to gather researchers and practitioners in the broad area of perception-aware autonomy. We attempt to highlight recent advances in these communities, discuss open problems and main challenges, and lay out new research directions.

**Main questions:**

- How to quantify data uncertainty for the purposes of controls?
- How to build robust and reliable machine learning models?
- How can robots safely interact with humans?
- Role of logic and formal methods in machine learning and robotics?
- What are the available tools and benchmarks?
- How to define/agree on a set of standard benchmark problems?

## Submission Info

We invite submissions of poster abstracts on any topic within the theme of the workshop: safe and verifiable autonomy. We accept published and ongoing work. The authors of the accepted abstracts will present their posters at the workshop. In addition, the pdf file of the posters along with their abstracts will be made available for general public on the workshop website. 

Abstracts should be 1-2 page long in RSS paper format and are submitted through [EasyChair](https://easychair.org/cfp/CD-CURS-2023
).

Some of the abstracts may be invited to be extended into an article for publication in a special issue of a journal.
