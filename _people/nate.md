Hi, I’m Nate, a first-year PhD student and NSF graduate research fellow at CU Boulder. My current research interests involve incorporating learned dynamics into model-based control architectures. I would like to work towards a data-driven control framework that can provide guarantees on performance and safety while maintaining computational efficiency and scalability. Prior to landing at CU, I completed my BS and MS studies at Penn State University, where I investigated the dynamics and control of shape-morphing systems known as tensegrity structures. In my spare time, I enjoy tinkering with vehicle hardware and embedded systems. Outside of academics, I’m a passionate rock/ice climber and continue to be inspired by the unique rock formations that surround us here in Boulder.
