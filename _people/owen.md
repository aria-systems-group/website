Hello! I am a first-year Ph.D. student in the Robotics Department, originally from Medina, Ohio. I earned my B.S. in Aerospace Engineering from the University of Notre Dame, where I also founded IrishSat, a student satellite club. Prior to graduate school, I worked for nearly three years at Palski & Associates, Inc., focusing on rendezvous and proximity operations planning and logic development. My research interests center on quantifying the uncertainty between theoretical models and real-world robotic performance, with an emphasis on applying formal methods to ensure safety and robustness.
