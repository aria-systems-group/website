Hi! I’m Rayan, a PhD student in Aerospace Engineering at CU Boulder. My research focuses on developing control strategies and software for safety-critical systems. Specifically, finding optimal control methods that include formal safety specifications using Control Barrier Functions. I obtained my Master of Science degree in Aerospace Engineering from Delft University of Technology, The Netherlands. I was a (Fulbright) researcher for two years at the Robotics Section of NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, where I developed models for astrodynamics applications. I enjoy outdoor activities, with playing soccer being my absolute favorite.
