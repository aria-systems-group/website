Hello! I am Nicolas, a current Master's student in Aerospace Engineering at CU Boulder. I completed my undergraduate studies at CU Boulder as well, earning degrees in both Aerospace Engineering and Computer Science in 2024. My research interests focus on quick, low-latency motion planning for dynamical systems in unknown environments. I am particularly interested in designing algorithms suitable for parallel processing and execution on GPUs, with the goal of deploying them in real-world systems. In my free time I enjoy 3D printing, hiking and spending time with family and friends.
