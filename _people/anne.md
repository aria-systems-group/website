Hi, I’m Anne and I’m just starting my Ph.D. here at CU Boulder. After getting my undergraduate degrees at Lehigh University, I got my start in engineering at Draper labs working on precision navigation instruments, like IFOGs. After a few years in the nuts and bolts (literally) of instrument prototyping and testing, I decided to move out to Boulder to pursue an MS in aerospace engineering. My work as an MS student stayed on theme with an atom-based inertial sensing project, but my contributions shifted to the controls side. Now I am exploring a wicked exciting new direction for my Ph.D. with the ARIA System Group. I work on navigation and objective planning for collaborative multi-agent systems exploring the lunar surface. We use formal methods to generate decision making strategies that maximize both mission value and safety.
