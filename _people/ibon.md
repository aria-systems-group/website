Hey there! I’m Ibón, a third-year PhD student in Aerospace Engineering at CU Boulder. I got my BSc in Aerospace Engineering in the Technical University of Madrid, Spain, and my MSc in Systems & Control in Delft University of Technology, The Netherlands. My research focuses on formal verification and control synthesis of stochastic systems, ensuring their correct and safe performance through a rigorous mathematical treatment. Such systems can be very complex, with nonlinear vector fields and disturbances, and sometimes the system model might not be available and it needs to be estimated from data. Additionally, I consider complex temporal logic specifications (e.g., reach-avoid, recursive/sequential reachability, etc.). I approach the problem by (i) obtaining a finite abstraction of the original system, namely, an uncertain (robust) Markov decision process (MDP), and then (ii) leveraging the UMDP to synthesize a controller under which the original system is guaranteed to satisfy the specification with a prescribed probability. The key components of this approach are (i) proving soundness of the abstraction, i.e., the UMDP can exhibit all behaviors that the original system can exhibit, which in the data-driven setting is obtained by leveraging statistical and maching-learning theory and (ii) designing efficient abstraction and control synthesis algorithms, which typically are particular instances of robust dynamic programming with an unbounded time horizon.

My interests include sequential decision-making under uncertainty, formal methods, safety-critical systems, UMDP abstractions and machine learning.
