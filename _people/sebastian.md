Hello! I'm Sebastian, a Master's student in Aerospace Engineering at the University of Colorado Boulder. I'm in my fifth year of the Bachelor'sâ€“Accelerated Master's (BAM) Program. I finished my Bachelor's in Aerospace Engineering with a minor in Electrical Engineering in May 2025 and I'm currently working on my Master's in autonomous systems. My research focuses on task planning optimization, specifically developing algorithms to schedule parallelized tasks while respecting temporal dependencies between them: managing precedence constraints, synchronization points, and deadline requirements to optimize overall system performance. Currently I'm working on extending Timed Partial Orders to increase their expressivity without adding complexity for users, since alternative temporal reasoning approaches tend to have steep learning curves. When I'm not working, I enjoy going to the gym, watching movies, and playing basketball.
