Hello, I’m Emily Maxwell, a current Master’s Student in Aerospace Engineering Sciences at CU Boulder, with plan to pursue a PhD here after the completion of my Master’s. I completed my BS in Computer Engineering at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology in 2025. Before joining the ARIA Systems Group, I did research on explainable machine learning and safe trajectory planning under uncertainty with genetic algorithms. My current research focuses on a human-centered approach to collaboration with autonomous systems, and I am co-advised by Dr. Katya Arquilla. Outside the lab, I hang out with my two cats,—Matcha and Earl—sporadically binge-read books, beat up my husband at Brazilian jiu jitsu, and occasionally slow down enough to play piano.
