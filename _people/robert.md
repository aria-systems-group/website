Hello! I'm Robert and I started my Ph.D. in the ARIA Systems Group in Fall 2021. After getting my undergraduate degree at MIT, I spent a few years working as a Controls Engineer at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Lab. My work there expanded my interests in control theory and encouraged me to delve into research for autonomous systems. My research interests include safety verification of systems with unknown dynamics, neural network output verification, and formal synthesis. In my spare time, I like rock climbing, kickboxing, and playing with my dog (though I do that when busy too).
