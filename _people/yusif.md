Hey! I'm Yusif, a first year PhD student in the Robotics Program at CU Boulder. I received my BS degrees in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering from West Virginia University. My research interest involves the implementation of formal methods for robust task and motion planning with applications in the robotics domain. My current research is focused on multi-objective motion planning, aimed at improving the quality of plans along various dimensions. In my spare time, I enjoy hiking, taking road trips, and watching the sun set over the Rockies.
